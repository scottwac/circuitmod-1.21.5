Circuit Mod* is a technology mod made to try and fit the "vanilla" aethetic; run performantly; and be fun, complex, and feature rich while being simple enough for the average player to enjoy.

Development is currently in alpha, during which machines will evolve from their current singular block machines to indepth, engaging, and immersive multiblock structures.
Some technologies are being developed for this; such as a new from-scratch energy networking system. Other fluids, radiation, and more systems are also in development.
